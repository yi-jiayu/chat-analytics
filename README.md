through the "Email Conversation" option to analyse and visualise the conversation.

## Supported visualisations

Just like the Punch Card repository graph on GitHub, the punch card view shows the frequency
of messages sent in a conversation based on day of week and time of day, with the number of
messages sent represented by bubble size.
